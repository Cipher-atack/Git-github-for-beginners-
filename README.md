# Git and GitHub for Absolute Beginners

Hello and welcome! This guide is designed for anyone who is just starting their journey in coding and wants to learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Don't worry if you've never heard of themâ€”we'll start from the very beginning.

Git is an essential tool for every developer. It's a **version control system** that helps you track changes to your code over time. Think of it as a super-powered "save" button that keeps a history of everything you do.

GitHub is a platform that hosts your Git projects. It's like a social network for developers, where you can share your code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.

This guide will take you step-by-step from installing Git to creating your first project on GitHub. Let's get started!

## 1. Getting Started: Installing Git

Before we can start using Git, we need to install it on our computer.

### For Windows

1. Go to the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. The download should start automatically.
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer. You can keep the default settings for most of the options.
4. After installation, open the **Command Prompt** or **Git Bash** and type `git --version` to confirm it was installed correctly.

### For macOS

1. The easiest way to install Git is by installing Xcode Command Line Tools. Open your **Terminal** and type: `xcode-select --install`
2. Alternatively, you can download the installer from the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
3. You can also use a package manager like Homebrew: `brew install git`
4. To check if it's installed, open your **Terminal** and type `git --version`.

### For Linux

1. Open your **Terminal**.
2. If you are on a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), use the command: `sudo apt-get install git`
3. If you are on a Fedora-based system, use: `sudo dnf install git`
4. To verify, type `git --version` in your Terminal.

## 2. Setting Up Your Identity

After installing Git, you need to tell it who you are. This information will be attached to every change you make.

1. Open your **Terminal** or **Git Bash**.
2. Set your username (use your GitHub username): `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
3. Set your email address (use the email you used for GitHub): `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`

You can verify your settings by typing: `git config --list`
